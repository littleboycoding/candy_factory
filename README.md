Manage NFT collections manually can get crumblesome, creating metadata yourself usually get boring !

with Candy Factory, you just import any images, edit metadata and export that can easily be consumed.

All is done in graphical and consistent way !

> Cross-platform, native performance, powered by [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) 🐦

## Feature
- Import any image
- Update metadata
- Export (currently only support Pinata)

## Idea ?
- Deploy as candy machine smart contract
- Setting OpenSea's attributes

## Terms
- [Candy machine](https://docs.metaplex.com/overviews/candy_machine_overview)
- [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)

## Release ?
No pre-built binary available (yet), however you can easily build it yourself with `flutter build` commands.

## Motivation
This project was created for Flutter/Dart learning purpose, hence part of my codebase can be bad 🍝
